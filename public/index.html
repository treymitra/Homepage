<h1>Shobhan "Trey" Mitra</h1>
<h3>Developer</h3>
<p>

My name is Shobhan Mitra but you can call me Trey. I'm 25, and have completed the final project in my Computer Information Systems B.A. I just moved from Minneapolis, Minnesota to pursue my dream of working for one of the many wonderful companies that are located in the San Francisco bay area. I have a deep passion for technology and strive to be on the forefront of social connectivity and productivity. I am determined, results oriented and a quick learner.  I've worked in the areas of help desk and desktop support positions and derive great satisfaction interacting and helping people. I've also worked as a Web developer and very much enjoy the creativity and challenges within the design process.
